# C-language
# Introduction to c
- C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs.
- It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write the UNIX operating system.
- The main features of the C language include:
- 1.General Purpose and Portable
- 2.Low-level Memory Access
- 3.Fast Speed
- 4.Clean Syntax
- These features make the C language suitable for system programming like an operating system or compiler development.
- Application of C :
- 1 Operating systems,2 Embedded systems,3 System software
- 4 Networking,5 Database systems,6 Gaming
# Compiling the C Programs
- Commands For Compile and Run
- To compile: gcc filename.c -o filename.exe
- To run: .\filename.exe

# C Comments
- The comments in C are human-readable explanations or notes in the source code of a C program.
- A comment makes the program easier to read and understand.
- Types of comments in C
- In C there are two types of comments in C language:
  1 Single-line comment(//)  2 Multi-line comment(/*---*/)
- [Single line comment](https://github.com/mochi-vidhi/C-language/commit/80674fd42e304fe6f7b240c0c19e80be83233955)
- [Multi line comment](https://github.com/mochi-vidhi/C-language/commit/80674fd42e304fe6f7b240c0c19e80be83233955#diff-af8c69563645eb506d0e9edcbf61e30a4ad27b9462ec5e438efb5d0be28e8aa0)

# Variables in C
- variable is a local storage of your code.(RAM)
- DECLARATION OF VARIABLES:
- data_type var_name; EX  int number; 
- ASSIGN VALUE TO VARIABLES:
- data_type var_name=value; EX int age=18;
- RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES:
- 1.must start with _underscorer or alphabets. EX._underscorer var_name or int number
- 2.not start with number[0-9] or special character. EX.data_type 9 or data_type @
- 3.do not any reserved keyword. EX. data_type if 
- 4.do not use any special character or space in var_name. EX.hard disk,hard@disk

# Constants in C
- The constants in C are the read-only variables whose values cannot be modified once they are declared in the C program.
- The type of constant can be an integer constant, a floating pointer constant, a string constant, or a character constant.
- [Constants Defination](https://github.com/mochi-vidhi/C-language/commit/2346ca53bde18dcc60e1c33b0d1353d27d0702c8#diff-d2269d599d21c4bdd528c497b8947bb0504a1da00f016f7f98436f818c36add3)
# Data-types in C
- 1 [Primary DataType/Primitive data-type](https://github.com/mochi-vidhi/C-language/commit/5c63bc22a54eed5b81f896e26fdd3d29e1cab317) - int,float,char,double
- 2 [Size of DataType](https://github.com/mochi-vidhi/C-language/commit/5c63bc22a54eed5b81f896e26fdd3d29e1cab317)
- 2 Void DataType - void,No input & output,Empty,NULL.
- 3 Derived DataType - Pointer,Function,String,Array
- 4 User Define DataType - Structure,Union,Enum,Typedef
# Basic Input and Output in C
- C language has standard libraries that allow input and output in a program.
- The stdio.h or standard input output library in C that has methods for input and output.
- [Formate specifiers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/format-specifiers-in-c/?ref=lbp)
- printf() : In C language, printf() function is used to print formatted output to the standard output stdout (which is generally the console screen).
  The printf function is a part of the C standard library <stdio.h> and it can allow formatting the output in numerous ways.
- scanf() : In C programming language, scanf is a function that stands for Scan Formatted String.
- It is used to read data from stdin (standard input stream i.e. usually keyboard) and then writes the result into the given arguments.
  It accepts character, string, and numeric data from the user using standard input.
  scanf also uses format specifiers like printf.

# Operators 
- In C language, operators are symbols that represent operations to be performed on one or more operands.
- a + b = c  equation / operation
- a, b, c  operand
- +, =    Operators
- Types of Operators
- [1. Arithmatic Operators]()
- [2. Assignment Operators]()
- [3. Comparison Operators]()
- [4. Bitwise Operators]()
- [5. Increment / Decrement Operators]()
- [6. Logical Operators]()
